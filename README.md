# AlgorithmsAndDatastructure
Self complied algorithms and datastructure completed in assignments in the course IDATT2101 Autumn 2023

These algorithms and datastructrues follow the course material to IDATT2101 Autmn 2023 at Norges Teknisk og Naturvitenskaplige Universitet (NTNU)
The course have given mandotory assignments that each student has to complete to take the course exam.
Each assignments is given points with a max score of 2 points. 1 point is rewarded if the assignment is completed without any corrections and 1 point if the assignment is completed on time. 

This repo is used by me to store the different alogrithms so that i could have a refrence point if I need to look back on the algorihtms in the future.
